            a
            traditional mancala-style game that has roots in various cultures within the religion. It is a
            two-player game that involves controlling a row of <b>small houses (small hole)</b> and
            <b>a larger storehouse (large hole)</b> at their respective ends of the board.
            <br><br>
            Congkak requires tactical thinking, planning, and careful execution of moves to outplay the opponent
            and
            accumulate more seeds in the storehouse by the end of the game. Congkak is not only a source of
            entertainment but also holds cultural significance in the regions where it is played, often passed down
            through generations as a traditional pastime. It fosters social interaction, strategic thinking, and
            mathematical skills among players.
            <br><br>
            If you&#39;re looking for something fun to play, congkak is a classic Malaysian game that&#39;s easy to
            learn.
            While congkak looks and plays similar to mancala, it introduces distinct rules that require
            consideration before initiating the game. Stay tuned as we will guide you through the gameplay
            mechanics, including board setup and executing your moves.

                When it is on your turn, choose one of the 7 houses in the row closest to you.
                Take out all the pieces and go clockwise around the board, dropping 1 piece into each
                house. <br>
                Make sure to drop 1 piece into your storehouse when you pass it, but skip over your

                If you drop the last piece in your storehouse, choose any other house on your side of the

                If you drop your final piece into one of your vacant houses, place that piece along with
